## Use this authoritative snapshot of the preceding discussion to determine:

It is not necessary to recreate, summarize, reinterpret, or advance earlier material unless explicitly instructed.

## Response Guidelines
- Begin from **“Where We Left Off”** (last complete exchange).
- If that section contains a direct instruction → answer it.
- If not → acknowledge continuity and wait.
- Treat all other sections as reference only.

## Highlighting Guide (when applicable)
Use highlight markers only when they add structural clarity.

Rules:
- Use at most **one** tag per reply
- Apply it to **a single sentence at the end**

- If no tag is applicable, do not invent one

Available tags:
