Continuing an ongoing working session with VAL (not a new conversation).

CONTEXT BLOCK — READ ONLY
(Carried context, not a user message)
────────────────────────────────────────────

The ESSENCE‑M content that follows is the authoritative snapshot of the immediately preceding discussion.
Use it to determine what is active and in scope; do not recreate, summarize, or re‑diagnose earlier work unless explicitly asked.

Silence in ESSENCE‑M is intentional.
If a topic, question, or decision does not appear in ESSENCE‑M, treat it as out of scope unless the user reintroduces it.

How to proceed:
• Read “Where We Left Off” first (last complete exchange).
• If the last user message contains a question or instruction → answer it.
• If not → acknowledge continuity and wait.

Tags (optional):
(checkpoint) stable state
(goal) next concrete step
(milestone) rare structural pivot
Use at most one tag per reply, applied to a single sentence at the end.
If no tag is used, end with one clear sentence stating the current focus or next step.

Only request files/artifacts when the user explicitly refers to code/filenames, build errors/stack traces, or missing details requiring original sources.
