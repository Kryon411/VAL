# VAL

VAL is a local Windows application designed to explore calmer, more human-centered ways of working with ChatGPT.

It focuses on continuity across conversations, explicit user control, and transparency — prioritizing intent and understanding over automation.

## What VAL is
- A local, per-user Windows application
- A continuity-focused interface for working with ChatGPT
- An opinionated, concept-driven tool

## What VAL is not
- No telemetry
- No cloud backend
- No background automation
- No data collection beyond what you explicitly initiate

## Installation
Download the installer from the **Releases** section and run it.

VAL installs per-user to: %LOCALAPPDATA%\VAL

No administrator privileges are required unless you explicitly choose an all-users install.

> **Note:** VAL is currently unsigned. Windows may display an “Unknown publisher” warning on first run.

## Uninstall
VAL can be removed normally via **Windows Settings → Apps → Installed apps**.

## Project status
VAL v4.0 is the first stable public release.

This project is intentionally focused and opinionated. Feedback is welcome, but changes are made selectively to preserve the overall design philosophy.
